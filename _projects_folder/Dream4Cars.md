[Dream4Cars](https://www.dreams4cars.eu/en/) is a European project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 program. The project started in January 2017 and ended on December 2019 with a founding of 4.3 million euros.

The main objective of Dreams4Cars is to set up an offline simulation mechanism in which robots by recombining aspects of real-world experience, can produce an emulated world, with which they can collectively interact to safely develop and improve their Perception-Action systems, in particular focusing on the analysis of rare events.

The partners are multidisciplinary with a good balance of the competencies that are needed for the project. The partnership comprises seven partners from five countries Italy, Sweden, United Kingdom and Germany. The partners are: University of Trento (Italy), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy), University of Parma (Italy), University of Pavia (Italy), University of Skovde (Sweden), University of Sheffield (United Kingdom), and Middlesex University (United Kingdom), as well as two industrial partners: DFKI (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz GmbH, Germany) and CRF (Centro Ricerche Fiat S.C.p.A., Italy) and Heich Consult (Germany).
