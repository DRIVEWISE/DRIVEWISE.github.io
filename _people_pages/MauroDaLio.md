biodata: "Mauro Da Lio received the Laurea degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Padova, Italy, in 1986. He is Full professor of mechanical systems with the University of Trento, Italy. His earlier research activity was on modelling, simulation and optimal control of mechanical multibody systems, in particular vehicle and spacecraft dynamics. More recently his focus shifted to the modelling of human sensory-motor control, in particular drivers and motor impaired people. Prior to his academic career, he worked for an offshore oil research company in underwater robotics (a EUREKA project). He was involved in several EU framework programme 6 and 7 projects (PReVENT, SAFERIDER, interactIVe, VERITAS, AdaptIVe, and No-Tremor). He is currently the coordinator of the EU Horizon 2020 Dreams4Cars Research and Innovation Action: a collaborative project in the Robotics domain which aims at increasing the cognition abilities of artificial driving agents by means of offline simulation mechanisms broadly inspired to the human dream state."
