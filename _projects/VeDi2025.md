VeDi2025 is an Italian project funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE). The project started in January 2022 and will end in April 2024.

The project is developed in direct collaboration with STELLANTIS (former FCA) and CRF (Centro Ricerche Fiat S.C.p.A.). The project aims to develop a cooperative obstacle avoidance system based on V2X communication. The system will be tested on a fleet of vehicles provided by STELLANTIS.
