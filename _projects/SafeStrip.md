[SAFE STRIP](https://safestrip.eu/) is a European project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 program. The project started in May 2017 and ended on April 2020 with a founding of 4.5 million euros.

The goal of this project is to introduce a disruptive technology that will embed Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) applications in existing road infrastructure, including I2V and V2I communications as well as VMS/VSL functions into low-cost, integrated strip markers on the road.

SAFE STRIP is undertaken by a multidisciplinary and complementary Consortium of 18 Partners from 6 countries. The partners are: CRF (Centro Ricerche Fiat S.C.p.A., Italy), Piaggio Group(Italy), Swarco (Italy), CEA (France), CONTI (France), Valeo (France), RELAB (Italy), CERTH (Greece), University of Trento (UNITN Italy), University of Patras (UPAT Greece), Fraunhofer Group IAO (Germany), CNR (National Research Council, Italy), CIDAUT faundation (Spain), CTI (Computer Technology Institute and Press "Diophantus", Greece), ICCS (Institute of Communication and Computer Systems, Greece), ATTD (Greece), A22 (Autostrade del Brennero S.P.A. Italy).
