We are glad to share that both posters from our research group obtained first and second place at the **Poster Session Competition** during the **Industrial Engineering Day** organized by the **UniTrento DII** at the **University of Trento**.

We are proud to announce that our colleagues Mattia Piazza and Mattia Piccinini won the first place with the poster "MPTREE: Motion primitive tree exploration for trajectory planning with dynamic and cooperative obstacle avoidance". Moreover, Sebastiano Taddei and Mattia Piccinini won the second place with the poster "Artificial Race Driver".

We want to thank the **UniTrento DII** for organizing the event and the **University of Trento** for the opportunity to present our research. We are also grateful to Prof. Francesco Biral and Prof. Mauro Da Lio for guiding and supporting us.

This success reflected our effective teamwork, innovative thinking, and a shared passion for advancing intelligent and autonomous vehicles.

Congratulations to Mattia Piazza, Mattia Piccinini and Sebastiano Taddei!
